           Withdrawal/Cancelation right.
        </h1>
        If you sign up for a Trial, you agree that the withdrawal right for the
        paid Subscription for which you are receiving a Trial ends
        “------------------” (----) days after you start the Trial. If you don't
        cancel the Paid Subscription before the Trial ends, you lose your right
        of withdrawal and authorize “------------------” to automatically charge
        you the agreed price each month until you cancel the Paid Subscription.
        For trials less than “------------------” (----) days, you expressly
        consent to us providing you with the paid service immediately after the
        end of your Trial and that from that point you lose your right of
        withdrawal.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you purchase a Paid Subscription with no Trial, you agree you have
        “------------------” (----) days after your purchase to withdraw for any
        reason and must pay us for the services provided up until the time you
        tell us that you have changed your mind. You expressly consent to us
        providing you with the service immediately following your purchase, that
        you lose your right of withdrawal, and authorize “------------------” to
        charge you automatically each month until you cancel.
